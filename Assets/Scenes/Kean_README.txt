I have two sections included in this project
1)  Combined Flocking Behaviours ( Cohesion, Separation, Alignment) with Seeking (1 Red Cylinder) and Fleeing (2 red cubes)  --- All in the scenes.

2)  FiniteStateMachine
to run automatically the 4 states :    Initialize , seek , Persue, and Flee  behaviours .
( all in 3 Green Cubes)

Unfortunately, I have tried my best , i only manage to produce console.log statement in the Console.

Anyway, thanks Ralph for everything , you have been a very good teacher and patient as well. I should have approached you earlier . Anyway, thanks a lot.
